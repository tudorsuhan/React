                    Devio was founded out of a desire to solve problems through coding. 
                    We cut our fingers working in the IT industry for 6 years before we started this company. 
                    We learned about people personality types, tight deadlines, shoestring budgets, and DIY work ethics. 
                    In previous years, everyone was thinking outside-the-box. 
                    We noticed the box was empty and moved right in. 
                    Now we occupy the whole thing with ideas so practical that they push creative boundries 
                    and create awesome projects for our clients.
                    At Devio, we believe that the effective interplay between design and functionality is what sets our websites, 
                    web shops and apps apart from other digital agencies. 
                    Weâ€™re transparent with our customers and because we consider their projects to be our own, 
                    the results are beautiful, useful and responsive.
                    Our door is always open for a good cup of coffee and conversation.
